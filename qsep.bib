	      membrane traffic, but so far nothing is known about its pathway
	      or its cargo. We have used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out the AP-5
	      $\zeta$ subunit gene, AP5Z1, in HeLa cells, and then analysed the
	      phenotype by subcellular fractionation profiling and quantitative
	      mass spectrometry. The retromer complex had an altered
	      steady-state distribution in the knockout cells, and several
	      Golgi proteins, including GOLIM4 and GOLM1, were depleted from
	      vesicle-enriched fractions. Immunolocalisation showed that loss
	      of AP-5 led to impaired retrieval of the cation-independent
	      mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR), GOLIM4, and GOLM1 from
	      endosomes back to the Golgi region. Knocking down the retromer
	      complex exacerbated this phenotype. Both the CIMPR and sortilin
	      interacted with the AP-5-associated protein SPG15 in pull-down
	      assays, and we propose that sortilin may act as a link between
	      Golgi proteins and the AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 complex. Together, our
	      findings suggest that AP-5 functions in a novel sorting step out
	      of late endosomes, acting as a backup pathway for retromer. This
	      provides a mechanistic explanation for why mutations in
	      AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 cause cells to accumulate aberrant
	      endolysosomes, and highlights the role of endosome/lysosome

	      organelles is poorly understood. Integrating microscopy,
	      subcellular fractionation, mass spectrometry, and functional
	      analyses, we conducted a cell-wide study of organelles in primary
	      fibroblasts throughout the time course of human cytomegalovirus
	      (HCMV) infection. We used label-free and isobaric-labeling
	      proteomics to characterize nearly 4,000 host and 100 viral
	      proteins, then classified their specific subcellular locations
	      over time using machine learning. We observed a global
	      reorganization of proteins across the secretory pathway, plasma
	      membrane, and mitochondria, including reorganization and
	      processing of lysosomal proteins into distinct subpopulations and
	      translocations of individual proteins between organelles at
	      specific time points. We also demonstrate that MYO18A, an
	      unconventional myosin that translocates from the plasma membrane
	      to the viral assembly complex, is necessary for efficient HCMV
	      replication. This study provides a comprehensive resource for
	      understanding host and virus biology during HCMV pathogenesis.",
