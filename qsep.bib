                  pathway is the identification and localization of
                  new proteins to increase our understanding of the
                  functions of different organelles. Previous
                  proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have
                  been hindered by contaminating proteins, making it
                  impossible to assign proteins to organelles. Here we
                  have used the localization of organelle proteins by
                  the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with
                  isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation
                  and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous
                  assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular
                  compartments. With this approach, the density
                  gradient distributions of 689 proteins from
                  Arabidopsis thaliana were determined, enabling
                  confident and simultaneous localization of 527
                  proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi
                  apparatus, vacuolar membrane, plasma membrane, or
                  mitochondria and plastids. This parallel analysis of
                  endomembrane components has enabled protein
                  steady-state distributions to be
                  determined. Consequently, genuine organelle
                  residents have been distinguished from contaminating
                  proteins and proteins in transit through the
                  secretory pathway.},
